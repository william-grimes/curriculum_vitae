# Curriculum vitae and cover letter
This directory contains my curriculum vitae and an accompanying template cover letter, inspired by the work of [MNandor](https://github.com/MNandor/cv).

## Generate CV
`pdflatex william_grimes_cv.tex`

## Generate cover letter
`pdflatex william_grimes_letter.tex`

## Nota bene
To compile SVG content for example on first running the `--shell-escape` flag is required, as follows `pdflatex --shell-escape william_grimes_cv.tex`.
