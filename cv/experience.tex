\subsection{Numerico \hfill 2018 -- 2021}
    \begin{list2}
        \item Developed software from initial research to national roll-out to optimise traffic inspector deployments on Dutch highways, reducing average time to attend incidents by 45 \%.
        \item Led data science research projects on the use of camera data to monitor traffic flow and speed, and analysis of accident blackspots on highways.
        \item Developed an emergency vehicle routing and travel time engine using GPS trace data.
        \item Responsible for maintaining cloud infrastructure and developing a CI/CD deployment pipeline using Docker Compose and Jenkins.
    \end{list2}

\subsection{DSSG \hfill 2017 -- 2018}
    \begin{list2}
        \item Developed an open-source fishing risk web application using RShiny, combining vessel tracking data with satellite imagery, scoring vessels according to likelihood of illegal fishing behaviours.
        \item Created a model for predicting road accidents in the Netherlands using a bouquet of classifiers (XGBoost, random forest, SVM) with road features, weather features, and temporal features.
        %\item Learning car accidents occurrence probability on the Dutch highways using transport, weather and road data.
        % \item Established AWS EC2 and PostgreSQL infrastructure for several teams, whilst mentoring a team of four, giving them technical advice and performing code reviews.
    \end{list2}
