As a full stack data professional, my expertise lies in applying machine learning to \textbf{geospatial} and \textbf{image data}. I'm deeply committed to software development and prioritise creating maintainable, scalable systems through test-driven development. My ultimate goal is to leverage technology to drive positive social outcomes, and I relish the opportunity to collaborate with cross-functional teams to achieve this shared mission.
